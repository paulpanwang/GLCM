# GLCM
GLCM calculates the statistics specified in properties from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix glcm. glcm is an m-by-n-by-p array of valid gray-level co-occurrence matrices. If glcm is an array of GLCMs, stats is an array of statistics for each glcm. graycoprops normalizes the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) so that the sum of its elements is equal to 1. Each element (r,c) in the normalized GLCM is the joint probability occurrence of pixel pairs with a defined spatial relationship having gray level values r and c in the image. graycoprops uses the normalized GLCM to calculate properties.
